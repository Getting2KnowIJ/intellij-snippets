# Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA
## IntelliJ IDEA Code Snippets

This repository contains Java code samples that demonstrate some of the key features of IntelliJ IDEA. These code samples are snippets which are only a line or two long. There are repositories with more complete examples for tutorials for learning IntelliJ IDEA [here](https://github.com/getting2KnowIJ/).

To use these samples, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. If you do not have a project open, choose "Get from VCS" from the Welcome Dialog.
4. If you already have a project open, go to the "Git" or "VCS" menu and select "Clone...".
3. Paste `https://github.com/Getting2KnowIJ/intellij-snippets` into the URL input box, and select a location to clone the project to, and press the "Clone" button.

[This video](https://youtu.be/aBVOAnygcZw) shows a walkthrough of the process using the classic UI.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the code and set up an IntelliJ IDEA project. We are currently using Java 22 and Gradle to build this project, but it will work with Java 8 and higher. 

The code contains comments that tell you what to do to demo the features. All of these samples are shown in detail in the book [Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA](https://bit.ly/3XrKwbX).
